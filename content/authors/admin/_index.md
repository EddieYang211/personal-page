Welcome! I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at UC San Diego. I study the politics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and develop tools for causal inference with high dimensional data.

Prior to UC San Diego, I received my MA from the University of Chicago and BA from UCLA.
